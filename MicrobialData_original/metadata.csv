We also examined a set of inflammatory markers in blood: C-reactive protein (CRP), intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-binding protein (LBP), and soluble CD14 (sCD14).We observed elevated levels of some blood markers for microbial translocation in ME/CFS patients; levels of LPS, LBP, and sCD14 were elevated in ME/CFS subjects.

However, whether ME/CFS is associated with an altered microbiome has remained uncertain. Here, we profiled gut microbial diversity by sequencing 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes from stool as well as inflammatory markers from serum for cases (n=48) and controls (n=39). We also examined a set of inflammatory markers in blood: C-reactive protein (CRP), intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-binding protein (LBP), and soluble CD14 (sCD14).We observed elevated levels of some blood markers for microbial translocation in ME/CFS patients; levels of LPS, LBP, and sCD14 were elevated in ME/CFS subjects. Levels of LBP correlated with LPS and sCD14 and LPS levels correlated with sCD14. Through deep sequencing of bacterial rRNA markers, we identified differences between the gut microbiomes of healthy individuals and patients with ME/CFS. We observed that bacterial diversity was decreased in the ME/CFS specimens compared to controls, in particular, a reduction in the relative abundance and diversity of members belonging to the Firmicutes phylum. In the patient cohort, we find less diversity as well as increases in specific species often reported to be pro-inflammatory species and reduction in species frequently described as anti-inflammatory. Using a machine learning approach trained on the data obtained from 16S rRNA and inflammatory markers, individuals were classified correctly as ME/CFS with a cross-validation accuracy of 82.93 %.sOur results indicate dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in this disease and further suggest an increased incidence of microbial translocation, which may play a role in inflammatory symptoms in ME/CFS.",MiCoDa

Furthermore, we show relatively subtle gut microbiome changes in HIV infection in MSM and women that include an increase in potential pathogens that is ameliorated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Lastly, using a longitudinal cohort, we describe microbiome changes that happen after ART initiation.ConclusionsThis study provides an in-depth characterization of microbiome differences that occur in a US population infected with HIV and demonstrates the degree to which these differences may be driven by lifestyle factors, ART, and HIV infection itself. Understanding microbiome compositions that occur with sexual behaviors that are high risk for acquiring HIV and untreated and ART-treated HIV infection will guide the investigation of immune and metabolic functional implications to ultimately target the microbiome therapeutically.",MiCoDa

By adjusting for differences in gut maturity, an ordered succession of microbial phylotypes was observed in breast milk-fed infants, which appeared to be disrupted in those fed infant formula.

The purpose of this study was to establish the influence of nutritional exposures on the intestinal microbiome in a cohort of preterm infants early in life.Principal component analysis of 199 samples from 30 preterm infants (<32 weeks) over the first 60 days following birth showed that the intestinal microbiome was influenced by postnatal time (p<0.001, R2=0.13), birth weight (p<0.001, R2=0.08), and nutrition (p<0.001, R2=0.21). Infants who were fed breast milk had a greater initial bacterial diversity and a more gradual acquisition of diversity compared to infants who were fed infant formula. The microbiome of infants fed breast milk were more similar regardless of birth weight (p=0.049), in contrast to the microbiome of infants fed infant formula, which clustered differently based on birth weight (p<0.001). By adjusting for differences in gut maturity, an ordered succession of microbial phylotypes was observed in breast milk-fed infants, which appeared to be disrupted in those fed infant formula. Supplementation with pasteurized donor human milk was partially successful in promoting a microbiome more similar to breast milk-fed infants and moderating rapid increases in bacterial diversity. The preterm infant intestinal microbiome is influenced by postnatal time, birth weight, gestational age, and nutrition.

Data were analyzed by linear mixed modeling and linear regression.Clinical data and fecal microbiome profiles of 45 VLBW infants (gestational age 27.9 -2.2 weeks; birth weight 1126- 208 g) were studied. Three stool samples were analyzed for each infant at mean postnatal ages of 9.9-3, 20.7-4.1, and 29.4-4.9 days. The average relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria was 42.5% (0-90%) at 2 weeks, 69.7% (29.9-86.9%) in the 3rd, and 75.5% (54.5-86%) in the 4th week (p<0.001). Hierarchical and K-means clustering identified two distinct subgroups: cluster 1 started with comparatively low abundance that increased with time, whereas cluster 2 began with a greater abundance at 2 weeks (p<0.001) that decreased over time. Both groups resembled each other by the 3rd week.

To this end, we performed next generation sequencing-based metagenomic analysis to determine the composition of the microbiota in CRC patients after anti-cancer treatments. The microbial 16S rRNA genes were analyzed from a total of 69 fecal samples from four clinical groups, including healthy individuals, CRC patients, and CRC patients treated with surgery or chemotherapy. The findings suggested that surgery greatly reduced the bacterial diversity of the microbiota in CRC patients. Moreover, Fusobacterium nucleatum were shown to confer chemoresistance during CRC therapy, and certain bacterial strains or genera, such as the genus Sutterella and species Veillonella dispar, were specifically associated with CRC patients who were treated with chemotherapeutic cocktails, suggesting their potential relationships with chemoresistance. These candidate bacterial genera or strains may have the ability to enhance the dosage response to conventional chemotherapeutic cocktails or reduce the side effects of these cocktails.
